;;; org-supertag/automation/sync.el --- Synchronous Event Processing for Org-Supertag -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; This file implements synchronous event processing for the automation system.
;; It replaces the asynchronous queue-based approach with direct synchronous execution.
;;
;; Key improvements:
;; 1. Eliminates queue/timer indirection
;; 2. Provides immediate automation execution
;; 3. Maintains performance through smart caching and recursion protection
;; 4. Integrates with the new supertag-ops-commit system

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'supertag-automation)     ; For existing automation functions
(require 'supertag-ops-node)
(require 'supertag-ops-tag)
