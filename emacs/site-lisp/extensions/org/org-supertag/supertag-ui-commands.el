;;; Commentary:
;; This file provides the user-facing interactive commands for Org-Supertag.
;; These commands act as the entry points for user interaction, calling the
;; underlying operations and services.

;;; Code:

(require 'org)
(require 'org-id)
(require 'supertag-services-ui) ; For UI helper services
(require 'supertag-ops-node) ; For node operations
(require 'supertag-ops-tag)  ; For tag operations (e.g., tag completion)
(require 'supertag-ops-field) ; For field operations
(require 'supertag-ops-relation) ; For relation operations
(require 'supertag-services-query) ; For query operations
(require 'supertag-view-kanban)    ; For Kanban board view
(require 'supertag-services-sync) ; For sync services
(require 'supertag-services-capture) ; For capture services
(require 'supertag-core-store) ; For supertag--rebuild-all-indexes

;;
;; - Inheritance is defined via the `:extends` property in a tag's definition,

;; - A tag inherits the *fields* from its parent tag(s).
;; - This model is based on the tag definitions stored in the database, not on
;;   the headline structure of an Org file.
;; - The commands `supertag-set-child` and `supertag-clear-parent` are used
;;   to manage these `:extends` relationships.
