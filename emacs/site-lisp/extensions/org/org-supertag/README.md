## ⚡ Intro

Org-SuperTag is a database-backed Org workflow focused on structured tags and fields.

- **Pure Emacs Lisp**: No Python/EPC; load and go
- **Structured data**: `#tag` + fields on headings (queryable, automatable)
- **Local database**: One in-memory store persisted to disk (fast reads)
- **Sync service**: Incremental file sync with safety guards + diagnostics
- **Views & UX**: Node view, table view, kanban (for data-centric workflows)
- **Automation hooks**: React to field changes and keep metadata consistent
- **Optional vault isolation**: Treat each sync directory as its own DB/state (single active vault)

## 🚀 30-Second Quick Start

```emacs-lisp
;; 1. Install
(straight-use-package '(org-supertag :host github :repo "yibie/org-supertag"))

;; 2. Configure
;; Single vault (recommended)
(setq org-supertag-sync-directories '("~/org/"))

;; Multiple vaults (separate DB/state per directory)
;; (setq org-supertag-sync-directories '("~/org/" "~/work-notes/"))
;; (setq org-supertag-sync-directories-mode 'vaults)

;; 3. Initialize (run once)
M-x supertag-sync-full-initialize
```

**That's it.** No Python, no virtualenv, no complexity.

## 🎯 Core Concept: Tags as Database Tables

Traditional Org-mode:

```org
* Project Ideas :project:
```

Org-SuperTag 5.0:

```org
* Project Ideas #project
  - status: planning
  - priority: high
  - due: 2024-12-31
```

Each `#tag` becomes a database table. Each heading becomes a record.

## 📋 Essential Commands

| Command                | Key | What it does                 |
| ---------------------- | --- | ---------------------------- |
| `supertag-add-tag`     | -   | Add a tag to current heading |
| `supertag-view-node`   | -   | View/edit structured data    |
| `supertag-search`      | -   | Query your knowledge base    |
| `supertag-capture`     | -   | Quick note capture           |
| `supertag-view-kanban` | -   | Visual task management       |

## 🎨 Smart Queries

Find all high-priority projects due this month:

```lisp
(supertag-search '(and (tag "project")
                       (field "priority" "high")
                       (field "due" "2024-12")))
```

Find papers you haven't read yet:

```lisp
(supertag-search '(and (tag "paper")
                       (field "status" "unread")))
```

## 🔄 Migration from 4.x

**One-time migration required:**

1. Backup your old database
2. `M-x load-file RET supertag-migration.el RET`
3. `M-x supertag-migrate-database-to-new-arch RET`
4. Restart Emacs

## 🔄 Property to Field Migration

**Convert Org Properties to Structured Fields**

Org-SuperTag 5.3 introduces a powerful migration system to convert your existing Org `:PROPERTIES:` drawers into structured database fields. This enables better querying, automation, and data management.

### Two Migration Paths

#### Path 1: Already Using Org-roam (Headings have `:ID:` properties)

If your Org files already have `:ID:` properties on headings:

1. **Add IDs to all headings** (if missing):
   ```elisp
   M-x supertag-migration-add-ids-to-org-headings
   ```
   Select your Org directory to add `:ID:` properties to all headings.

2. **Sync to database**:
   ```elisp
   M-x supertag-sync-full-rescan
   ```
   This imports all nodes with their properties into the database.

3. **Convert properties to fields**:
   ```elisp
   M-x supertag-convert-properties-to-field
   ```
   Choose a property (e.g., "LOCATION"), select/create a tag, and convert.

#### Path 2: Not Using Org-roam (Headings lack `:ID:` properties)

If your Org files don't have `:ID:` properties:

1. **Add IDs to all headings**:
   ```elisp
   M-x supertag-migration-add-ids-to-org-headings
   ```
   This adds `:ID:` properties to all headings.

2. **Sync to database**:
   ```elisp
   M-x supertag-sync-full-rescan
   ```

3. **Convert properties to fields**:
   ```elisp
   M-x supertag-convert-properties-to-field
   ```

### What Happens During Conversion

When you convert a property like `:LOCATION: London`:

1. **Database updates**:
   - Node gets the specified tag (e.g., `#place`)
   - Field value is stored in database (`LOCATION = "London"`)

2. **Org file updates**:
   - Tag is inserted in headline: `* My Heading #place`
   - Properties drawer remains unchanged for compatibility

3. **Query capabilities**:
   - Find by field: `(field "LOCATION" "London")`
   - Find by tag: `(tag "place")`
   - Combined queries work seamlessly

### Batch Conversion

Convert multiple properties at once:

```elisp
M-x supertag-batch-convert-properties-to-fields
```

This shows statistics for each property and lets you choose tags for each conversion.

### Before/After Example

**Before**:
```org
* Project Meeting
:PROPERTIES:
:LOCATION: Conference Room A
:ATTENDEES: Alice, Bob, Carol
:END:
```

**After** (in database):
- Node has tag: `meeting`
- Fields: `LOCATION = "Conference Room A"`, `ATTENDEES = "Alice, Bob, Carol"`

**Org file**:
```org
* Project Meeting #meeting
:PROPERTIES:
:LOCATION: Conference Room A
:ATTENDEES: Alice, Bob, Carol
:END:
```

### Benefits

- **Better queries**: Search by field values, not just text
- **Automation**: Trigger rules based on field changes
- **Data integrity**: Structured data with validation
- **Views**: Table views show field columns automatically
- **Backward compatibility**: Original properties remain intact

## ⚙️ Configuration

Minimal config:

```emacs-lisp
;; Single vault (recommended)
(setq org-supertag-sync-directories '("~/org/"))

;; Multiple vaults (separate DB/state per directory)
;; (setq org-supertag-sync-directories '("~/org/" "~/work-notes/"))
;; (setq org-supertag-sync-directories-mode 'vaults)
```

Vault mode notes:
- Auto-switch is disabled by default; enable with `(setq org-supertag-vault-auto-switch t)`.
- Shows a mode line hint `ST[<vault>]` for the current file (when multiple sync directories are configured).
- Manually switch with `M-x supertag-vault-activate` (vault mode only).

Smart scan (sync safety):
- Each sync computes a content hash and compares it with the last synced hash.
- If the hash is unchanged, parsing is skipped and the database stays untouched.
- This prevents accidental database clears caused by mtime-only touches or redundant sync triggers.

With AI features (optional):

```emacs-lisp
(setq org-supertag-bridge-enable-ai t)  ; Uses gptel
```

## 🆚 Why Not Use...

| Tool | What it’s best at | How Org-SuperTag differs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Org-roam | Zettelkasten + backlinks + graph | Org-SuperTag is **data-first**: tags-as-tables, fields, database queries, and views, while still providing a rich reference system (`supertag-add-reference`) that shows up in views (node/table). |
| Denote | Minimal, file-based note organization | Org-SuperTag adds a **database layer**: structured fields, rich queries, and views; Denote stays intentionally lightweight and file-centric. |

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Database corrupted?**

```lisp
M-x supertag-sync-cleanup-database
```

**Want to see what's in your database?**

```lisp
M-x supertag-search
```

**Need to debug sync issues?**

```lisp
M-x supertag-sync-analyze-file
```

## 📊 Technical Details

- **Lines of code**: ~16K (down from ~30K)
- **Dependencies**: Just Emacs
- **Data storage**: ~/.emacs.d/org-supertag/
- **Backup**: Automatic daily snapshots
