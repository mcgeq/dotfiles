;;; org-supertag/transform.el --- Core data transformation mechanism for Org-Supertag -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; This file implements the central data transformation mechanism for the
;; Org-Supertag data-centric architecture. It provides a functional,
;; atomic, and consistent way to modify the application state.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib) ; For cl-loop, cl-find, etc.
(require 'ht) ; Ensures `ht` API availability
(require 'supertag-core-store) ; Depends on supertag-get and supertag-update
(require 'supertag-core-state) ; For shared state variables
(require 'supertag-core-notify) ; For supertag--notify-change

;;; --- Core Transform Function ---

(defun supertag-transform (path fn &rest args)
  "Transform data at PATH using function FN.
PATH is a list of keys (e.g., '(:nodes \"123\" :tags)).
FN is a function that receives the current value as its first argument,
and ARGS as subsequent arguments. Returns the transformed value.

Canonical store mode restricts PATH to collection or collection-entity locations."
  (unless (and (listp path) path)
    (error "PATH must be a non-empty list, got: %S" path))
  (when (> (length path) 2)
    (error "Canonical transform only supports collection/entity paths, got: %S" path))
  (let* ((current-value (supertag-get path))
         (new-value (apply fn current-value args)))
    ;; Update store with new value directly.
    ;; Validation is handled by specific ops functions in hybrid architecture.
    (supertag-update path new-value)

    ;; If in a transaction, log the change for potential rollback
    (when supertag--transaction-active
      (push (list path current-value new-value) supertag--transaction-log))

    ;; Return new value
    new-value))

;;; --- Batch Transform ---

(defun supertag-batch-transform (transforms)
  "Execute multiple transformations in a batch, ensuring atomicity.
TRANSFORMS is a list of (path fn args...) tuples.
Notifications are suppressed until all transformations are complete."

             (args (nthcdr 2 transform)))
         (let ((new-value (apply #'supertag-transform path fn args)))
           (push (cons path new-value) results))))
     (supertag--notify-batch-changes)) ; Call batch notification after all transforms
    (nreverse results)))

;;; --- Transaction Support ---

(defmacro supertag-with-transaction (&rest body)
  "Execute BODY within a transaction.
If an error occurs during BODY execution, all changes will be rolled back.
Notifications are suppressed until the transaction commits."
